        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Swarnanjali Pendyala, a committed student of Information Technology at BVRIT Narsapur, India, pursuing excellence with a CGPA of 8.75. My academic and hands-on experience spans Java, C/C++, SQL, Python, and front-end technologies, supplemented by robust skills in Flutter for mobile development.

            As an Intern at NewTab Technology, I developed a product tracking system using Dart and Flutter, enhancing my proficiency in application development and project management. My training with the National Stock Exchange as part of the Elite TalentSprint program further honed my problem-solving skills and understanding of functional programming with Haskell.
            
            I have engaged in several projects, including 'DelivTrack', a logistics tracking system, and 'VSYLLABUS R22', a university course management application, demonstrating my ability to manage complex software solutions effectively. Recognized for my leadership skills, I have also organized and led technical programs and coding competitions at college events.
            
            Passionate about leveraging my technical knowledge and teamwork skills, I am eager to secure a Developer role where I can contribute to and grow with innovative technology projects.</p>
